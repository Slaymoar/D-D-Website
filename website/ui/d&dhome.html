    <p> <center>Kesuk, Smot, and Tenebris are in Ypsi and something strange is going on...<p/>
	<p> Our friends find themselves in front of Mikes house with no place to park, and a text that says <br/> "Hey, can you come by when you get this? My neighbors are acting weird as fuck.". <br/> With no place to park in front of Mikes house the three park in front of the neighbors...</center><p/>

	<p><center><strong> CHAPTER 1: The Frat House </strong></center><p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three friends park the car and immediately notice weird sounds coming from the 3-4 awkward shapes on the front lawn. Stepping onto the sidewalk *cthing* they begin to pass the frat house, *smash!* Smot is hit in the head with a bottle. Kesuk, spotting what could have been the thrower, walks up to the human-like shape on the railing, and plants his fist firmly in its face. The now obviously not human shape falls to the porch in a crumpled heap. There were three goblins in easy view on the front lawn.  One in a heap on the porch, one by the front door, and one on the low porch roof about 7 feet up.  Smot realed, trying to pull himself together from the 40oz. bottle to the head. Seeing that there was going to be no talking, Tenebris comes forward and.... The goblin by the door immediately took aim at Kesuk and lunged.  With a flick of his hand Kesuck deflected the goblin from his chest. <p/>
    <p><center><strong>CHAPTER 2: Wayward Pines</strong></center></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh off the train to the small city of Wayward Pines, the three friends notice the sound, or lack thereof.  No people in site, but posters everywhere describing the danger and warning signs of "The Plague".  Having rested on the train, Tenebris suggests that they set out to the Apothecary.  The apothecary is darkly lit, smells like an old library, everything is dusty, and the only books they can see all have weird symbols on them. As they move farther into the shop, an old lady (presumably the owner) hobbles out wearing a dust mask.</p>
    <p>Old lady: Can I help you guys, we're closing soon... Is there something you're looking for? <br/>Tenebris: Hi how are you? We're visiting from out of town… (Tenebris winks)  We heard you had a nice fountain!   Why are you wearing your mask? <br/>Old lady: Huh? Oh you're from out of town… Well you should be careful the sickness is going around you should probably get some some masks.<br/>Tenebris:  Do you sell any masks?<br/>Old lady: Uhhh no.<br/>Tenebris: *Turning to the other two* Oh shit!! *he begins to cackle*.<br/>Kesuk: *speaking up over the cackle* Do you have any extra masks we might be able to buy off you?<br/>Old lady: *She hesitates…* How much money you got?<p/>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenebris, looking for the first time takes note of how fragile the old woman looks. He begins to ponder how easy it would be to overpower her.<p/>
    <p>Tenebrous: Well we don't really plan on sticking around for too long, but we do have business here is there a place we could stay that you know of?<br/>Old lady: Yeah the inn around the corner is really nice, but as you guys aren’t from around here you should be careful out there during the daytime.<br/>Kesuk and Smot: The daytime?<br/>Old lady: Yeah the day time is when the weirdos in the sick or out and about so finish your business and… *she trails off expecting that her Point has been conveyed*.<br/>Tenebris: Alright well we'll be seeing you later! (Does finger guns at the old lady, turns and walks away)<p/>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three exit the apothecary, the door loudly bolted behind them.  Momentarily baffled by the rudeness of being locked out immediately tell him bro steps forward to lead the charge.<p/>
    <p>Tenebris: Into the Smith we go!</p>
